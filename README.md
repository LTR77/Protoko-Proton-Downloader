# Protoko Proton Downloader
This is my first GUI Application in Python using TKinter.  
It lets you download various compatibility tools for Steam.  
### for Example:  

Proton GE: https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom  

SteamTinkerLaunch: https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch  

Proton TKG: https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/actions/workflows/proton-arch-nopackage.yml (requires authentication via GitHub)  

Proton TKG Valve Experimental: https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/actions/workflows/proton-valvexbe-arch-nopackage.yml (requires authentication via GitHub)

## And many more !

# INSTALLATION
To Install download the Code:  
Press Green "Code" Button then "Download ZIP"  
Or Follow the same Steps but Download the Latest Release and Extract It.  
  
Then install the dependencies by running:
```console
pip install -r resources/requirements.txt
```  
then just run it by running:
```console
python3 Protoko.py
```
## OR
Run the appimage* like this:
```console
./Protoko-x86_64.AppImage
```
 or install AppImage Launcher and run it with that
 *AppImage contains many bugs as of right now (05 04 2025) and therefor is not recommended to be used
# THIS IS LINUX ONLY  
!! works on my machine, YMMV !!
